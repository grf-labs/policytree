Description: Learn optimal policies via doubly robust empirical
 welfare maximization over trees. This package implements the multi-action doubly
 robust approach of Zhou, Athey and Wager (2018) <arXiv:1810.04778> in the case where
 we want to learn policies that belong to the class of depth k decision trees.
